# KillMouseAccel

In OS-X, it has a rather aggressive acceleration curve for mice.

Normally, this works fine.

But if you use a gaming mouse (like [Razer](http://www.razerzone.com/)) then you probably don't want the acceleration.  It can cause things to become jumpy or otherwise misbehave.

## Compile

```
clang -framework CoreFoundation -framework IOKit killmouseaccel/main.c -o killmouseaccel

# for cross compiling
clang -target x86_64-apple-darwin killmouseaccel/main.c -framework CoreFoundation -framework IOKit -o kma-x64
```

## Run

```
./killmouseaccel mouse
```

Effect goes away after a restart

## Origin

This is originally code found on http://forums3.armagetronad.net/viewtopic.php?p=196564#p196564

I just put it into an xcode project, removed the warnings and got it to compile.

I wanted to make sure I could find this code again if I had to re-install everything.
